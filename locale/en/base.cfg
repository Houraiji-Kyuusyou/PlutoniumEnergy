[item-description]
MOX-fuel=Gives much more energy than uranium cell, but at half rate.
used-up-MOX-fuel=This fuel cell ran out of energy, but can be reprocessed into additional plutonium.
industrial-reactor=Industrial reactor for industrial nuclear processing.
MOX-reactor=Plutonium's slower energy production allows to make reactor smaller.
plutonium-rounds-magazine=Pistol or submachine gun round made out of plutonium!
plutonium-cannon-shell=Cannon shell made out of plutonium!
explosive-plutonium-cannon-shell=Explosive cannon shell made out of plutonium and some explosives!
plutonium-atomic-bomb=Compact surface annihilation weapon.\nToo weak to be real plutonium atomic bomb, btw.

[technology-description]
plutonium-nuclear-power=Gives much more energy than uranium, but 2 times slower.
MOX-fuel-reprocessing=The process of reprocessing used MOX fuel to get additional plutonium.
plutonium-ammo=Advanced ammunition from plutonium for higher damage
plutonium-atomic-bomb=Atomic bomb made with plutonium instead of uranium. Explosion power is higher by nearly 40%.
