plutonium-atomic-bomb=Plutonium atomic bomb

[technology-description]
plutonium-processing=Processing of plutonium, radioactive element that don't exist in nature but can be created in nuclear reactor.
plutonium-nuclear-power=Gives much more energy than uranium, but 2 times slower.
MOX-fuel-reprocessing=The process of reprocessing used MOX fuel to get additional plutonium.
plutonium-ammo=Advanced ammunition from plutonium for higher damage
plutonium-atomic-bomb=Atomic bomb made with plutonium instead of uranium. Explosion power is higher by nearly 40%.

[mod-setting-name]
PE-disable-MOX-reactor=Disable MOX reactor recipe
PE-disable-U238-excess-neutron-capture-recipe=Disable Uranium-238 excess neutron capture recipe

[mod-setting-description]
PE-disable-MOX-reactor=Disables MOX reactor for compatibility with some mods.
PE-disable-U238-excess-neutron-capture-recipe=Disable Uranium-238 excess neutron capture recipe. Some players want this recipe disabled for balancing reasons.

[mod-description]
PlutoniumEnergy=Adds processing of plutonium, an excess product from nuclear reaction. Plutonium can be used to make ammo (even plutonium atomic bomb) and to generate power as MOX fuel.
