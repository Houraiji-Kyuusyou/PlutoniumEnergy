# Plutonium Energy

This mod adds new material - plutonium (238 and 239 isotopes). Using it, you can make nuclear fuel (MOX fuel) which generates energy 2 times slower, but has 2 times more energy in one cell (comparing to uranium). MOX reactor is also smaller (3x3 instead of 5x5), so it allow to pack them more densily to increase energy production.

And with energy generation part comes along destructive part. This mod also adds plutonium ammo - cannon shells, machine gun / pistol ammo, plutonium atomic bomb, which speaking with numbers is around 1.4 times more powerful than uranium one. And if you installed mods that add uranium artillery shell / bomb, this mod also adds a plutonium variant (Currently supported only Atomic Artillery mod).
